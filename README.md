# Shallow Discourse Parser
This is an implementation of the standard Lin et al. architecture.
It consists of four components for classifying explicit discourse relations.
Currently implicit relations are not supported (wip).
The current implementation is following the Conll2016 implementation guidelines and uses the PDTB2 Conll format.
